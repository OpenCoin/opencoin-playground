# Reviews

For the first version of OpenCoin we had funding from the [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Development_Agency), which allowed us to get OpenCoin reviewed from a technical and legal perspective.

## Technical / Crypto review

The review of the preliminary protocol was done by:

- [Alex Dent](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/%7Ealex/)
- [Kenny Paterson](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/%7Ekp/)
- [Peter Wild](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/peter-wild(a2da6542-0ed5-43e2-bd1f-87cec74c18a0).html)

The [technical review](opencoin_crypto_summary.pdf) did not find "any obvious flaws". [^chair] 

## Legal review

We also had a legal review of our ideas by:

- [Chris Reed](http://www.ccls.edu/staff/reed.html) 
- [George Walker](http://www.ccls.edu/staff/walker.html)

The [legal report](opencoin_legal_summary.doc) examines under which circumstances
OpenCoin could be run (at the time). Legal circumstances have changed since then, so we would recommend do have another legal review.

There was also a [freemind mindmap](legal.mm), that shows the structure of the legal issues. Here exported as an image:
